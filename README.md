# Aluminium Alloy Density Prediction using Machine Learning
## Overview
This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict the density of aluminium alloys. By utilizing the composition of the alloys as features, the model aims to estimate their density, which is a crucial property in materials science and engineering.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can predict the density of aluminium alloys based on their composition. The features used in the model are the various elements present in the alloy, and the target variable is the density of the alloy.

## Features
Composition: Chemical elements present in the aluminium alloy (e.g., Si, Fe, Cu, Mn, Mg, Cr, Zn, Ti).
Property (Target): Density of the aluminium alloy.
